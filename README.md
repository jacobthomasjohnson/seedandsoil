# Seed & Soil
### Project Overview
Simple garden simulation where the user can "plant" random seeds in the garden on-screen. Then, they can use water from their resources to "grow" those seeds into larger plants. This project was intentionally kept small in scope. In the future, I may add more features.

### Possible Features to Add
- Add a "Shop" and "Currency" system, so the user can choose which plants to place.
- Add the ability to plant seeds where you choose to.
- Add "Upgrades" or unlocks which will help expedite progress.
